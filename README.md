In this second web design project, I created HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, organising them into appropriate folders while following the guidelines provided in the Codio PDF. I created three HTML pages: index.html, about.html, and chat.html, and I used an additional style.css file alongside Bootstrap to enhance the navmenu, footer, and buttons. I set up a server using Node.js and employed Express as the web framework. Communication between our chat application, server, and client was facilitated through the socket.io library.

My objective for the page layout was to maintain a minimalistic and straightforward design while ensuring it remained elegant and visually appealing. I aimed to make information easily accessible for visitors, focusing on avoiding clutter and unnecessary complexity in the design.

Reflecting on the challenges I encountered during this project, I initially spent significant time attempting to implement socket.io independently without following the Codio instructions. However, my progress accelerated considerably once I aligned my efforts with the Codio guidelines. Although connecting the socket.io server and client proved somewhat challenging, I gained valuable insights from this experience.
